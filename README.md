<h2>What is AirDrums?</h2>

AirDrums is a python program that lets you play air drums using two coloured sticks and <a href="https://www.virtualdrumming.com/drums/online-virtual-games/ian-paice-rock-drum-set.html">virtualdrumming.com</a>

Here's a <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBAoFhbCh6c&feature=youtu.be"> Video Demo for AirDrums </a>

<h2>Installation and Requirements</h2>

Download the code, open <a href="https://www.virtualdrumming.com/drums/online-virtual-games/ian-paice-rock-drum-set.html">virtualdrumming.com</a> on your web browser and you're good to go! 
Make sure that you have the required libraries installed, you can do so by typing the following commands in your terminal:

OpenCV Installation:
```
pip install opencv-python
```

PyAutoGui Installation:
```
pip install pyautogui
```

Keyboard installtion:
```
pip install keyboard
```

Now, all you need is a red coloured drum stick and a blue coloured drum stick. Just having the ends of the sticks coloured is enough too, alternatively, you can use a red and blue coloured sharpie as well. 

Note: The kit I am using is Ian Paice Drum Set
